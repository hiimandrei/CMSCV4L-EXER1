				<h4>Favorite CMSC Subject: <i>CMSC 123</i></h4>
				<p>		CMSC 123 has changed my way of approaching a problem and finding solutions for them. There was nothing really new about C that was taught in the course, rather, it just reframed our mindsets on how we can use what we've learned in CMSC 22.

				<h4>Favorite GE(s): <i>Ethics 1 and KAS 1</i></h4>
				<p>		Not only were my profs great, the subjects themselves were too. I felt like learned something that I can apply to myself and to the society. I didn't feel confined with academics alone.

				<h4>Favorite PL: <i>R</i></h4>
				<p>		Getting comfortable with R took me quite some time because I viewed it as something very similar to Python, but when Sir Clinton showed us how to properly use it, translating thoughts into literal codes was a breeze.

				<h4>Favorite Food: <i>(Filipino) CARBONARRAAAAAAAAAAA</i></h4>
				<p>		Its creaminess.... Its sauce...... ITS EVERYTHING!!! There's nothing you could possibly not love about it.
